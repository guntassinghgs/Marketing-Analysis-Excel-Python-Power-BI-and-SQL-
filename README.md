- *Top Demographics*:  
    
    30-34 age group has the highest contribution towards sales with lower AD spend, more focused marketing startegies are required to tap this particular age segment.

    Analyzing different campaigns, we can understand the audience targeting strategy from campaign B for future product launches combining with more efficient conversion strategies like discounts, vouchers etc.



- *Actionable Recommendations*:  
    - Reallocate budget focus to Campaign A and B targeting younger audience (30-40) males and females. 
    - We can focus ad campaigns on the top-performing interest groups to maximize approved conversions and avoid or reconsider spending on low-performing interest groups to improve ROI.  
    - Review underperforming campaigns for possible optimization or removal
